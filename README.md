    .NET 8 SDK

Installation

Build the project:

bash

    dotnet build

Usage
Running the Application
There are two projects:
BowlingCounter is for the console application
BowlingServer is for the web version

I advise using BowlingServer for the web version, as it is more advanced

To run the application, switch to either the BowlingCounter or BowlingSever directory and use the following command:

bash

dotnet run
